# Project Management System

This is a comprehensive project management system designed for a group of freelance programmers working on several projects. It's built with Ruby v2.7.2, Ruby on Rails v6.1.3.2, Bootstrap 5 CSS, and Simple Forms Gem.

## Detailed Description
This project management system is a robust web application that allows users to manage and organize their projects effectively. It provides a platform for users to create, edit, and delete projects and groups, enhancing collaboration and productivity.

Users can sign up and log in to the system, with the option to attach an avatar during the sign-up process. Once logged in, users can create new projects either associated with a group or as standalone projects. They can also create new groups, providing a way to categorize and manage related projects.

Projects associated with a group are displayed in the 'All Projects' section, while standalone projects are listed under 'External Projects'. Users can add new projects to a group, enhancing the flexibility of project organization.

One of the key features of this system is the ability to associate new projects with an existing group right from the project creation page. Projects associated with a group will display the first group's image, while standalone projects will have a placeholder image.

The system also provides a feature to view all projects from all users associated with a group, promoting transparency and collaboration among users. An added feature includes a list of all users, where one can view all the projects created by each user, further enhancing transparency.

The system also allows users to edit and delete projects and groups, providing full control over their data. The application is user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface, as demonstrated by the preview images.

This project management system is a powerful tool for managing projects, promoting collaboration, and enhancing productivity.
